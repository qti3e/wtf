# About Me

I'm Parsa <span style="color: gray; font-size: 0.7em">(Alireza)</span> Ghadimi. SF. Writing code for about 15 years.

Currently at [Deno](https://deno.com), working on Deno Deploy. Before that I was CTO at Fleek, a decentralized hosting platform, where I led a team of 30+ engineers for 4 years.

My first job was working for Ryan Dahl in 2018 on PropelML—machine learning tooling for JavaScript. That same year I was an early contributor to Deno before it went public. I was 16. A lot has changed since.

## Some Things I've Helped Build

- **Deno Deploy (nextgen)** — my current full-time job
- **Fleek Network** — led development as Lead Engineer → CTO (we raised $25M)
- **IC Kit** — SDK for Dfinity's Internet Computer
- **XTC** — utility token holding $1M+ in cycles on Internet Computer
- **Markus** — declarative query language with a program verifier
- **WaterScript** — a JavaScript interpreter I wrote as a teenager. It wasn't good but I learned things.
- **Slye** — open-source 3D presentation software

And probably some more.

## Current Side Project

A JavaScript compiler in Rust. Zero dependencies—no std, no alloc, no libc, no libm, no compiler-rt, no Cargo. You have to invent the universe first, so it's going slowly. 2-3 years out.

The goal is aggressive: symbolic execution, e-graph-based IR, AOT compilation, and enough static analysis that if your server-rendered React app doesn't compile down to string concatenation, that's probably a bug in React. Or a CVE. Sometimes those are the same thing.

It also serves as an experimentational playground for me, a personal laboratory of sort where I'm forced to implement everything from ground up.

## Interests

Rust. TypeScript when necessary. Making things fast.

I like Go's philosophy more than I like writing Go. I like Nix because I want my computer to be a deterministic function of its configuration. I like reading source code—I have V8, LLVM, the Linux kernel, glibc, musl, GHC, and four SAT solvers cloned locally. Just in case.

I've implemented RFC 9111. I know more about `Vary` headers and cache revalidation than any person should. I have opinions about `--version` output and flag parsing.

If you want to talk about compilers, performance, JavaScript engines, or why your SSR framework has CVEs that only become visible when you optimize it too hard—I'm around. If you want to debate whether performance matters, I'm less around. It does.
